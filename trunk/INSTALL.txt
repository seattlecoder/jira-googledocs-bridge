This document describes how to install the Python modules to run the 
google-docs-jira.py script on Mac OS X and Linux.

## Mac OS X

1. Install gdata.
 1-1. Download the gdata module from:
      http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list
      and unpack it in your directory.

 1-2. Run the command in the gdata-<version> directory.

      For all users:
      > ./setup.py install

      To install it on your home directory
      > ./setup.py install --home=<your home directory>

      For more detail, go to 
      http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/python_client_lib.html

2. Install SOAPpy. You also need to install PyXML and fpconst.
 2-1. Download PyXML from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml/files/
      and unpack it.

      and unpack it. You will see the file at the bottom of the page.

 2-6. Modify file Client.py Types.py and Server.py in the 
      SOAPpy-<version>/SOAPpy directory. In each file, the line 'from future
