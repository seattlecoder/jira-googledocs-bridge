copy texts from the 'test-edit' file to the 'myTest' file (not a file copy)
since I could not download the 'test-edit' file.
It is to be able to test the format change during document download/upload.
NOTE: after copying the texts: header, footer, comment, footnote, and 
      the 'Update now' button disappeared. 
      super/sub script position change - lined with normal texts


download 'myTest' and upload it using the Python google docs list API.
